# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise better analyze how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges 
I performed my analysis by following along with the requirements and completing all lesson assignments. Some challeneges I enocuntered were using the =countifs() formula. I am not very familiar with this formula so I had to do research and use the hints along the way to help. A possible challenge other people may have enocuntered	is the pivot table, the instructions were not very clear on how to make it or what data to use.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  The start of summer (May and June) was the most successful time to launch a campaign. The trend for failed and successful are consistant with eachother, an increase starting in April then decrease after May with a slight bump in October then down again to finsih the year.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  	The lower the goal amount the more likely your campaign will be successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
   Some limitations of this dataset are the location, you do not know where each successful campaign is by looking at this data. Another limitation in these graphs is you cannot compare the difference between successful campaign goals and the amount pledged. We could create a table and graph based on successful and failed theater campaigns by location. We could also dig into failed campaigns and see the difference in goal and pledged and if Louise needed to lower her goal amount.
